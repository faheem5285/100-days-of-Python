print(d)

e=45.6
print(type(e))
#! complex numbers or complex data type
#~ complex data type consist of two values one called real number and second called imaginary number
f=complex(23,34)   #we can use keyword with data type
g=3+7j             # we can also without data type but we can also use j with complex number
print(type(f))
print(type(g))
print(f.real)
print(f.imag)

#! List data type
mylist = [1,53,5,3]
